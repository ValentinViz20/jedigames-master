## Features
### Word guessing game:
> ⭐ **HOW TO PLAY**:  
— you need to guess words based on a definition  
— you are given only the length of the word, each letter of a words gives 100 points  
— you can request to see some of the word's letters, but each letter requested takes -100 points from the prize  
— you start with 3 minutes to guess, and once your turn starts, this time will count down and you can request letters  
— if you press the "GUESS" button the time will freeze and you have 30 seconds to guess the word, and you can't request letters anymore!   
— if you don't guess the word you will receive negative points  
— everyone will get 3 words of each length
